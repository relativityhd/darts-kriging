# Using geospatial methods on the DARTS v1 dataset

The notebook `darts-kriging.ipynb` demonstrates how to apply geospatial methods on a point dataset in python.
The point dataset used is the DARTS v1 dataset, which contains the locations of Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS).
The region of interest (ROI / AOI) is Banks Island, which is located in the Canadian Arctic.
The primary goal is to create a kriging model to predict the size of thaw slumps based on elevation data.

This work is intented to be a substitute for the homework of the course "Environmental spatial statistics and models" at the University of Potsdam.
